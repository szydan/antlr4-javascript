antlr4-javascript runtime as UMD
================================

## Why
I had to be able to load antlr javascript runtime in browser as AMD module 

## Build
Broserify is used to build a single UMD module from antlr4 package
To build type: 

    $ npm install 
    
The result module is in **release/antlr4.js**
